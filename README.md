Rock Paper Scissors Console Game

--- Play The Game
- Clone the repository and build the solution
- Run the existing project
- Choose between the available options:
- Human player should choose between available options
- If playing against computer, it will automatically choose an option on each round

I'm demonstrating the usage of a strategy pattern to add a new option to the game, take a look to the commit "Add FlameThrower option" to see how to add a new option.
